## Libraries Used
- **Plotnine:** A Python implementation of the ggplot2 library from R, known for its declarative and grammar-of-graphics approach.
- **Plotly:** An interactive visualization library that creates dynamic and web-based plots and dashboards.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/online-retail-dataset).

- **notebook/:** Jupyter notebooks where the data exploration, analysis, and visualization code resides.
- **HTML files/:** downloaded the responsive charts as html and added to index.html.

## Usage
To reproduce the results and visualizations, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-visualization-project.git`
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in the and execute the code cells.
3. The generated visualizations will be saved in the current directory.

## Results
The project includes the following visualizations:

- Pie Chart
- Bar Chart
- Scatter Plot
- Line Chart
- Histogram
- Box Plot
- Heatmap
- Responsive Map chart

## Conclusion
By utilizing Plotnine and Plotly, this project showcases the effectiveness of data visualization in communicating insights. The resulting charts and plots provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the data, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
